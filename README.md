# Soccer Stats

A simple web app to track soccer stats for a local seven-a-side team.

With this app, you can have a nice overview of the team's performance, and you can also track individual player stats.

Manage your team's stats via Appwrite dashboard, and display them on your NextJS website protected with Appwrite Auth.
